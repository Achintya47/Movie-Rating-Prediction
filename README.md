# Movie Rating Prediction
By **Achintya Sharma**

This project provides a structured pipeline for data analysis and modeling, broken into three stages:

### Project Stages:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and correlations.
2. **Data Visualizations:** Create insightful visualizations for better interpretation of the data.
3. **Model Building & Evaluation:** Build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

All three stages are combined in a single Jupyter Notebook, containing relevant code, explanations, comments, and documentation.
